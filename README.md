# IsingModel

A third-year physics undergraduate project at Imperial College London: Thermodynamic simulations using the Ising Model

* iterator.py

  * File implementing Metropolis algorithm and averaging of results.

* setup.py

  * File used by Cython to compile iterator.py to iterator.c.
  * Called with "setup.py build_ext --inplace".

* iterator.c

  * Equivalent iterator.py code in C, auto-generated by Cython.

* iterator.so

  * Python shared object. The format is unique to Mac/Linux, but
  * identical results will be obtained by importing iterator as the
  * python file, it will just run slower.

* Called with

  * "gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -Ofast -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.7 -c iterator.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/iterator.o"

  * followed by

  * "gcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -Ofast -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Werror=format-security build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/iterator.o -o /home/dcragusa/LAB/iterator.so"

* getresults.py

  * Uses iterator.so to generate results and save to pickle files.

* read.py

  * Reads results from pickle files and draws graphs.
